## To-Does Second Version

### Points - best 2 of a team (Chalke)
'best 2 in a race' in the case that you could have a race with 4 teams of 3 cars, but only the top 2 for each team scores team points?

### Collect Penalty Points
If a player has a certain amount of penalties, his/her overall points are reduced by a certain number.

## To-Does Third Version

### Manufacturer (Chalke)
You might consider having a 3rd layer of data for each car in the results in case anyone wanted to add a 'manufacturer' or 'engine supplier' to their league for fun? 
e.g Lewis Hamilton - Driver, Mercedes F1 - Team, AMG - Engine 
or Rene Rast - Driver, Abt - Team, Audi - Manufacturer
