### Manufacturer (Chalke)
You might consider having a 3rd layer of data for each car in the results in case anyone wanted to add a 'manufacturer' or 'engine supplier' to their league for fun? 
e.g Lewis Hamilton - Driver, Mercedes F1 - Team, AMG - Engine 
or Rene Rast - Driver, Abt - Team, Audi - Manufacturer
